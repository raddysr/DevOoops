# Tools

Some very basic scripts/programs that I've created for automating simple tasks


*general_report.pl and report.pl - create report of deamons(FreeBSD jails)

*mikrotik_backup.pl - backup and update mikrotik devices via ssh to rooter_os...

*apache_vhost_cr.pl - create virtual host(only you'll have to do is to run this script with sudo and add hosts and domain in ~/etc/hosts)
